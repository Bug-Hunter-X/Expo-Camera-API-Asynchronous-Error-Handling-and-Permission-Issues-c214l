# Expo Camera API Asynchronous Error and Permission Handling

This repository demonstrates a common yet sometimes tricky error encountered when using the Expo Camera API.  The error usually manifests as unexpected behavior or crashes, often related to permission handling or the asynchronous nature of the API. This repo provides example code illustrating the problem and solutions for proper error handling.

## Problem

The `Camera` component's behavior is asynchronous. Failure to properly handle asynchronous operations or manage permissions can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.  The exact error may vary, but often involves permission issues (especially on iOS) or race conditions during the loading of camera components.
