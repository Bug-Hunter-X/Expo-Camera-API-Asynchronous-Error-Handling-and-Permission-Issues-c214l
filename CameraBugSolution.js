To resolve this, make sure to handle permissions properly and ensure that all operations are correctly managed asynchronously.  Use `useEffect` to handle lifecycle events and `async/await` for asynchronous operations.

Here's an example of how to fix the problem:
```javascript
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';
import { Camera, CameraType } from 'expo-camera';
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const CameraScreen = () => {
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = useState(null);
  const [type, setType] = useState(CameraType.back);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
      setHasPermission(status === 'granted');
    })();
  }, []);

  if (hasPermission === null) {
    return <View/>;
  }
  if (hasPermission === false) {
    return <Text>No access to camera</Text>;
  }
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} type={type}>
        {/* Camera controls here */}
      </Camera>
    </View>
  );
};

export default CameraScreen;
```
This code ensures that camera permissions are explicitly requested before attempting to use the camera and correctly handles the permission response using async/await for asynchronous operations.
