This error typically occurs when using Expo's `Camera` API and involves issues with permissions or the asynchronous nature of the API.  The exact error message may vary slightly depending on the Expo SDK version and platform (Android or iOS).  Often, the error is not directly related to the code itself but rather to a misconfiguration or timing problem within the Expo environment or device settings.
